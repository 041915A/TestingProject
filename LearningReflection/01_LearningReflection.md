> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- My experience testing GitLab was generally positive and a great learning experience.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I used the provided examples to create my test suites and individual test cases in the template. I wrote down the steps I performed while completing the test scenario to create test cases.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I liked the template we used for test case management. It was simple, but I think it still included a lot of important details necessary for testing. It was easy to understand and use.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code because it was recommended and I have used it before in other courses.


## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I found it a bit difficult to keep track of what needs to be done because instructions were scattered across multiple files. I reviewed the files one by one to solve this issue.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I had no trouble using Github because I have used it before for creating a repository for other assignments.
 

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would probably try Robot Framework first because its syntax is easy to read and write. 


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Experience as a manual QA
- Experience in QA automation (e.g. Java)
- Experience in functional and non-functional testing
- Experience in CI/CD (e.g. Jenkins)
- Experience in version control (e.g. Git)
- Experience in working with automation testing frameworks (e.g. Selenium, Appium)


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I would most likely start learning about test automation tools and version control. I would also develop my communication skills to effectively collaborate with developers, report bugs, and provide feedback.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I think that the project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice but there was a lot of concepts that I did not get to try. However, I think that the size of the project is appropriate considering that it is only about 20 percent of the course grade. I would prefer more frequent smaller quizzes, because right now you have to go through a lot of theory before a quiz.
